# Card Inventory App
## About the App
Card Inventory is an Android app that organizes and maintains a database of a collection of greeting cards. Items can be added into a database by manual input or by a barcode scanner to fetch a record of the item's location in the store aisle or create a new item if the item does not yet exist in the database. All items can be listed and sorted according to the user's preferences, and said list can be exported to a CSV file in the local Downloads folder of the Android device.
## Motivation
This app was made as a management tool for a local gift shop selling greeting cards on a shelf. Customers who browse the cards colelction often don't return the cards back to their original location, leaving the cleanup to the store associates. By keeping track of the location of the items, store associates do not have to memorize the items' original place, and work is made efficient.

Another reason for this app was, of course, to keep track of item quantities. The store manager would often have to memorize which kinds of cards are in low quantities and may run into the error of stocking the wrong cards. Listing the item quanitities and exporting the sorted lists into a CSV file will make it easier for the store manager to know which kinds cards they should restock on.
